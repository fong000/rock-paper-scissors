# rock-paper-scissors
Second TOP Project
This is the second project from the TOP foundations page. I will learn how to make a rock paper scissors game which utilizies random generation. The user will play against a computer which will randomly generate rock paper or scissors. The user will select an item to see if they win. Wish me luck!
